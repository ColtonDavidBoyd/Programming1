* is multiply

/ is divide
  If you divide an interger, the computer will get rid of the decimal without rounding. 
  For example, if you divide 6 / 4 you would only get 1, because the integer must stay as an integer

% is modulus
  modulus gives you the remainder of what you divide by
    For example: if you don't use decimals 5 / 4 gets you 1 with a remainder of 1, 
    5 % 6 would give you only that remainder of 1
    27 % 4 would be 3. 24 is the largest number you can get without going over 27, so you subtract 24 from 27
    Any odd number % 2 will be 1, and any even number % 2 is 0

sqrt(x) is square root
pow(x, y) is x over the power of y
//both sqrt and pow, as well as trig functions require you to put #include <cmath> at the top of the program
sin(x)
cos(x)
tan(x)
log(x)
log10(x)
abs(x) (absolute value)
