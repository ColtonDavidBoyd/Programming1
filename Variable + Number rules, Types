To round, make an integer = a floating 
  Decimals will always round down
  To round up, add .5 to the floating point as you convert it
    For example: 17.9 will round down to 17
    When you add .5, it will be 18.4, and round down to 18
    Of course the number will still round down if its still below 18, like if you add .5 to 17.2, it will round down to 17
Adding or subtracting 1 from a variable is so common they created special shortcuts for them
  variable++
  variable--
